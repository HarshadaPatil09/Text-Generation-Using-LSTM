**Text Generation Using LSTM**

This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text generation, specifically focused on generating news headlines. The goal is to build a deep learning model capable of predicting the next word in a sequence based on previous words, thereby generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

**Project Overview**
The model is trained on a dataset of over 700 news headlines. By leveraging LSTM networks, which are well-suited for sequential data, the project explores how deep learning can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The resulting model can generate new headlines or text sequences based on a given seed text.

**Key Features**
Utilizes an Embedding layer to convert words into dense vector representations.
Uses an LSTM layer to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in the text.
Includes a Dropout layer to prevent overfitting during training.
The final Dense layer with a softmax activation outputs the probability of each word in the vocabulary being the next word in the sequence.
The model is capable of generating text by predicting one word at a time, appending each prediction to the input text to create longer sequences.

**Model Architecture**
Embedding Layer: Transforms input words into 10-dimensional dense vectors.
LSTM Layer: Consists of 100 units to capture sequential dependencies.
Dropout Layer: Helps reduce overfitting by randomly setting 10% of the input units to zero.
Dense Layer: Outputs a probability distribution over the entire vocabulary (2,217 words).

**Conclusion**
This project showcases the power of LSTM networks in generating text sequences based on input data. The model successfully learns patterns from news headlines and can be extended to various other domains, such as story generation, chatbots, and automated content creation. Future improvements may include experimenting with larger datasets, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and exploring more advanced architectures for even better results.
